## Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, and Q Learning

In this assignment, I used JAVA to run three RL algorithms on two MDPs. 
All java codes are in burlap folder. The Burlap codes were downloaded from https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap. 
Burlap package was modified accordingly to finish the experiments.

To run JAVA codes, install (if necessary) and run Intellij, and open folder burlap as a project. JDK 1.8 and maybe Maven update are necessary. 

Mark src as the source folder. 

Run main function in ValueIterationExperiments.java to do experiments on Value Iteration.
Run main function in PolicyIterationExperiments.java to do experiments on Policy Iteration.
Run main function in QLearningExperiments.java to do experiments on Q learning.
Run main function in CompareConvergence.java to do experiments on comparisons between algorithms on convergence and T.


All the output of files from the analysis are  in burlap/out folder.

To plot the results, copy the txt files to Assignment4Rcode folder, install (if necessary) and run the newest version of R Studio with ggplot2 and reshape2 packages installed. 

Open the mlA4.RMD file under the Assignment4Rcode folder in R Studio, and run all the R codes in the code chunks in sequence. 

The plots will be saved in Assignment4Rcode folder.
