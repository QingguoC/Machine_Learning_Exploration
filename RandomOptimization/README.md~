## Explore Random Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and MIMIC on 

In this assignment, I used JAVA to run optimizations of different problems. 
All java codes are in Assignment2RandomOptimization folder.

The train and test dataset of cancer classification is under Assignment2RandomOptimization/src/data folder.


To run JAVA codes, install (if necessary) and run Intellij, and open folder Assignment2RandomOptimization as a project. 

Mark src as the source folder. 

Add Assignment2RandomOptimization/libs/ABAGAIL.jar to library.

Then we are ready to run the RO codes. 

For cancer classification problem, the codes are in BreastCancer.java, simply run the main method to conduct the analysis.

For the second part of the assignment, run the main methods in FourPeaks.java, CountOnes.java, TravelingSalesman.java. 


All the output of files from the analysis are also in Assignment2RandomOptimization/src/data folder.

To plot the result, go to Assignment2Rcode folder, install (if necessary) and run R Studio with ggplot2 and reshape2 packages installed. 

Open the MachineLearningAssignment2Plots.RMD file in R Studio, and run all the R codes in the code chunks in sequence. 

The plots will be saved in Assignment2Rcode folder.
