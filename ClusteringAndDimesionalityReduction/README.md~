## k-means / Expectation Maximization (EM) for Clustering, and PCA, ICA, RP, FA for Dimensionality Reduction

I run all my codes in jupyter notebook (ipython notebook). 
The codes are in two ipynb files breast_cancer_assignment3.ipynb for breast cancer dataset, and leaf_assignment3.ipynb for leaf dataset. 
First, install anaconda first if not installed yet following instruction on https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.
I created and run my codes on Windows environment, but I think mac or linux user also can run my ipynb files by jupyter notebook.
update sklearn module to version: 0.19.0 if needed by run "conda update scikit-learn"
put my two datasets breast_cancer.csv and leaf.csv in the same directory with two ipynb files.
change working directory in CMD or terminal to the folder containing all my files.
type command "juypter notebook", then an ipython notebook (a localhost website working envonriment) will pop up
then double click two ipynb files on the directory list shown on the web browser
all my codes and the result tables and figures will be shown on the two ipython notebooks.
To rerun my codes, you can either run the code sections in sequence from the very beginning to the end or choose restart & run all in Kernel drop down list.
Or the results pictures are stored in pics folder.
